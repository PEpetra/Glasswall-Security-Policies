Glasswall is hereinafter referred to as \"the company.\"

1.0 Overview
============

A solid password policy is perhaps the most important security control
an organisation can employ. Since the responsibility for choosing good
passwords falls on the users, a detailed and easy-to-understand policy
is essential.

2.0 Purpose
===========

The purpose of this policy is to specify guidelines for use of
passwords. Most importantly, this policy will help users understand why
strong passwords are a necessity, and help them create passwords that
are both secure and useable. Lastly, this policy will educate users on
the secure use of passwords.

3.0 Scope
=========

This policy applies to any person who is provided an account on the
organisation\'s network or systems, including: employees, guests,
contractors, partners, vendors, etc.

4.0 Policy
==========

4.1 Construction
----------------

The organisation mandates that users adhere to the following guidelines
on password construction:

-   Passwords must be at least 8 characters.

-   Passwords should be comprised of a mix of letters, numbers and
    special characters (punctuation marks and symbols).

-   Passwords should be comprised of a mix of upper and lower case
    characters.

-   Passwords should not be comprised of an obvious keyboard sequence
    (e.g qwerty, 12345).

-   Passwords should not include \"guessable\" data such as company
    information or personal information about yourself, your spouse,
    your pet, your children, birthdays, addresses, phone numbers,
    locations, etc.

4.2 Confidentiality
-------------------

Passwords should be considered confidential data and treated with the
same discretion as any of the organisation\'s proprietary information.
The following guidelines apply to the confidentiality of organisation
passwords:

-   Users must not disclose their passwords to anyone.

-   Users must not share their passwords with others (co-workers,
    supervisors, family, etc.).

-   Users must not write down their passwords and leave them unsecured.

-   Users must only use a company approved password storage mechanism.

-   Users must not use the same password for different systems and/or
    accounts.

-   Users must not send passwords via email.

-   Users must not re-use passwords once they are required to be
    changed.

-   User must not use passwords associated with company accounts for
    non-company related activities and applications, such as social
    media, websites, gaming platforms etc.

4.3 Password Reset
------------------

Passwords must be reset if;

-   there is evidence or suspicion they have been phished.

-   it is suspected that company data has been stolen.

-   a company password is in the public domain.

4.4 Incident Reporting
----------------------

Users must immediately report any suspicious activity involving their
passwords to the IT Manager. When a password is suspected to have been
compromised the IT Manager will ensure that the user, or users, change
all their passwords.

4.5 Applicability of Other Policies
-----------------------------------

This document is part of the organisation\'s cohesive set of security
policies. Other policies may apply to the topics covered in this
document and as such the applicable policies should be reviewed as
needed.

5.0 Enforcement
===============

This policy will be enforced by the IT Manager and/or Executive Team.
Violations may result in disciplinary action, which may include
suspension, restriction of access, or more severe penalties up to and

of company property (physical or intellectual) are suspected, the
company may report such activities to the applicable authorities.
