1.0 Overview

Confidential data is typically the data that holds the most value to a company.  Often, confidential data is valuable to others as well,
and thus can carry greater risk than general company data.  For these reasons, it is good practice to dictate security standards that 
relate specifically to confidential data.

2.0 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to detail how Confidential Data, as identified by the Data Classification Policy, should be handled. This
policy lays out standards for the use of 
confidential data, and outlines specific security controls to protect this data.  

3.0 Scope

The scope of this policy covers all company-confidential data, regardless of location.  Also covered by the policy are hardcopies of 
company data, such as printouts, faxes, notes, etc.


4.0 Policy

4.1 Treatment of Confidential Data
For clarity, the following sections on storage, transmission, and destruction of confidential data are restated from the Data 
Classification Policy.

4.1.1 Storage
Confidential information must be removed from desks, computer screens, and common areas unless it is currently in use.  Confidential 
information should be stored under lock and key (or keycard/keypad), with the key, keycard, or code secured.

4.1.2 Transmission
Strong encryption must be used when transmitting confidential data, regardless of whether such transmission takes place inside or 
outside the company's network.  Confidential data must not be left on voicemail systems, either inside or outside the company's network,
or otherwise recorded.

4.1.3 Destruction
Confidential data must be destroyed in a manner that makes recovery of the information impossible.  The following guidelines apply:

	Paper/documents: cross cut shredding is required.
	Storage media (CD's, DVD's): approved methods of destruction is required.
  The following applies to, but is not limited to, Hard Drives, USB Storage Devices etc:
	All data must be securely overwritten or wiped, and must use an approved secure file deletion utility.
	Physical devices that cannot be overwritten or wiped must be destroyed beyond recovery.

4.2 Use of Confidential Data
The following applies to how users must interact with confidential data:

	Users must be advised of any confidential data they have been granted access to.  Such data must be marked or otherwise designated 
  "confidential."
	Users must only access confidential data to perform their job function.
	Users must not seek personal benefit, or assist others in seeking personal benefit, from the use of confidential information.
	Users must protect any confidential information to which they have been granted access and not reveal, release, share, email 
  unencrypted, exhibit, display, distribute, or discuss the information unless necessary to do his or her job or the action is 
  approved by his or her supervisor.
	Users must report any suspected misuse or unauthorised disclosure of confidential information immediately to his or her supervisor.
	If confidential information is shared with third parties, such as contractors or vendors, a confidential information or non-disclosure
  agreement must govern the third parties' use of confidential information.  Refer to the company's outsourcing policy for additional 
  guidance.
	If confidential information is shared with a third party, the company must indicate to the third party how the data should be used, 
  secured, and, destroyed.  Refer to the company's outsourcing policy for additional guidance.

4.3 Security Controls for Confidential Data
Confidential data requires additional security controls in order to ensure its integrity.  The company requires that the following 
guidelines are followed:

	Strong encryption must be used for confidential data transmitted internal or external to the company.  Confidential data must always 
  be stored in encrypted form, whether such storage occurs on a user machine, server, laptop, or any other device that allows for data 
  storage.
	The company must use firewalls, access control lists, or other security controls to separate the confidential data from the rest of 
  the corporate network.
	Two-factor authentication should be used, where applicable, for access to confidential data.
	Systems that contain confidential data, as well as confidential data in hardcopy form, should be stored in secured areas.  Special 
  thought should be given to the security of the keys and access controls that secure this data.
	When printing confidential data the user should use best efforts to ensure that the information is not viewed by others.  Printers 
  that are used for confidential data must be located in secured areas.
	No Confidential data should be sent as a Fax.
	Confidential data must not be emailed inside or outside the company without the use of strong encryption.
	If confidential information is sent outside the company, the user must use a service that requires a signature for receipt of that 
  information.  When sent inside the company, confidential data must be transported in sealed security envelopes, but not marked as 
  “confidential”.
	When confidential information is verbally discussed it should be done in non-public places, and where the discussion cannot be 
  overheard.
	Confidential data must be removed from documents unless its inclusion is absolutely necessary.
	Documents containing Confidential data must be marked as “Company Confidential” in the footer of each page.
	Confidential data must never be stored on non-company-provided machines (i.e., home computers).
	If confidential data is written on a whiteboard or other physical presentation tool, the data must be erased after the meeting is 
  concluded.


4.4 Examples of Confidential Data
The following list is not intended to be exhaustive, but should provide the company with guidelines on what type of information is 
typically considered confidential.  Confidential data can include:

	Employee or customer social security numbers or personal information.
	Medical and healthcare information.
	Customer data.
	Company financial data.
	Sales forecasts.
	Product and/or service plans, details, and schematics.
	Network diagrams and security configurations.
	Communications about corporate legal matters.
	Passwords.
	Banking information.
	Payroll information.
	Credit card information.
	Any confidential data held for a third party (be sure to adhere to any confidential data agreement covering such information).

4.5 Emergency Access to Data
A procedure for access to confidential and critical data during an emergency must be developed and documented.  The company must 
establish a procedure for emergency access in case the normal mechanism for access to the data becomes unavailable or disabled due to 
system or network problems.  

The procedure should answer the following questions:

	What process must be followed to activate the emergency access procedure?
	What systems will it will involve?
	In what situations should be activated?
	Will it be activated automatically if certain conditions are met, or will it require human intervention?  If so, who is authorised to 
  make the decision to implement the procedure?
	Who will be involved in the process and what roles will they perform?

4.6 Applicability of Other Policies
This document is part of the company's cohesive set of security policies.  Other policies may apply to the topics covered in this 
document and as such the applicable policies should be reviewed as needed.

Regarding encryption, please refer to the company’s encryption policy for further guidance.


5.0 Enforcement

This policy will be enforced by the IT Manager and/or Executive Team. Violations may result in disciplinary action, which may include 
suspension, restriction of access, or more severe penalties up to and including termination of employment. Where illegal activities or
