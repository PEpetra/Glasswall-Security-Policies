accessed by a program and that contain the complete set of information
on particular items).

**Remote Access:** Access to an al information system by a user (or a
process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through an external
network (e.g., the Internet).

**Risk Assessment:** The process of identifying risks to al operations
(including mission, functions, image, reputation), al assets,
individuals, or other s resulting from the operation of an information
system. Part of risk management, incorporates threat and vulnerability
analyses, and considers mitigations provided by security controls
planned or in place. (Synonymous with "risk analysis".)

**Role-based Access Control:** Access control based on user roles (i.e.,
a collection of access authorizations a user receives based on an
explicit or implicit assumption of a given role). Role permissions may
be inherited through a role hierarchy and typically reflect the
permissions needed to perform defined functions within an . A given role
may apply to a single individual or to several individuals.

**Router:** A device that interconnects networks using different layers
of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.

**Sanitization:** A general term referring to the actions taken to
render data written on media unrecoverable by both ordinary and, for
some forms of sanitization, extraordinary means.

**Screen blanker or screen saver:** A computer program that
automatically blanks the screen of a computer monitor or screen after a
certain period of inactivity.

**Secret information:** Particularly sensitive information, the
disclosure of which is expected to severely damage Company X or its
business affiliates.

**Security Controls:** The management, operational, and technical
controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an
information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the system and its information. \[FIPS 199\]

**Security Functions:** The hardware, software, and firmware of the
information system responsible for supporting and enforcing the system
security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which
the protection is based.

**Security Impact Analysis:** The analysis conducted by an al official
to determine the extent to which changes to the information system have
affected the security state of the system.

**Security patch:** A software program used to remedy a security or
other problem, commonly applied to operating systems, database
management systems, and other systems software.

**Sensitive information:** Any information, the disclosure of which
could damage Company X or its business associates.

**Security Label:** The means used to associate a set of security
attributes with a specific information object as part of the data
structure for that object.

**Security Marking:** Human-readable information affixed to information
system components, removable media, or output indicating the
distribution limitations, handling caveats and applicable security
markings. (For example, a label of CONFIDENTIAL stamped on an envelope
is a security marking based on a security label.) Also known as a
"Sensitivity Label."

**Security Plan:** Formal document that provides an overview of the
security requirements for an information system or an information
security program and describes the security controls in place or planned
for meeting those requirements.

**Security Requirements:** Requirements levied on an information system
that are derived from applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, standards, instructions, regulations, procedures, or al
mission/business case needs to ensure the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of the information being processed, stored, or
transmitted. \[FIPS 200\]

**Shared password:** A password known by or used by more than one
individual.

**Software macro:** A computer program containing a set of procedural
commands to achieve a certain result.

**Spam:** The abuse of electronic messaging systems to indiscriminately
send unsolicited bulk messages.

**Spyware:** Software that is secretly or surreptitiously installed into
an information system to gather information on individuals or s without
their knowledge; a type of malicious code.

**Special system privilege:** Access system privileges permitting the
involved user or process to perform activities that are not normally
granted to other users.

**Supply Chain:** A system of s, people, activities, information, and
resources (possibly international in scope) that provides products or
services to consumers and businesses.

**Suspending a user ID:** The process of revoking the privileges
associated with a user ID.

**System administrator:** A designated individual who has special
privileges on a multi-user computer system, and who looks after security
and other administrative matters.

**Terminal function keys:** Special keys on a keyboard that can be
defined to perform certain activities such as save a file.

**Threat:** Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely
impact al operations (including mission, functions, image, or
reputation), al assets, individuals, or other s through an information
system via und access, destruction, disclosure, modification of
information, and/or denial of service.

**Trusted Path:** A mechanism by which a user (through an input device)
can communicate directly with the security functions of the information
system with the necessary confidence to support the system security
policy. This mechanism can only be activated by the user or the security
functions of the information system and cannot be imitated by un-trusted
software.

**User IDs:** Also known as accounts, these are character strings that
uniquely identify computer users or computer processes.

**User:** Individual, or (system) process acting on behalf of an
individual, d to access an information system.

**Valuable information:** Information of significant financial value to
Company X or another party.

**Verify security status:** The process by which controls are shown to
be both properly installed and properly operating.

**Virus screening software:** Commercially-available software that
searches for certain bit patterns or other evidence of computer virus
infection.

**Vulnerability:** Weakness in an information system, system security
procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited
or triggered by a threat source.

**Vulnerability Assessment:** Formal description and evaluation of the
vulnerabilities in an information system.
