# Contents

### 

Glasswall is hereinafter referred to as \"the company.\"

1.0 Overview
============

Consistent standards for network access and authentication are critical
to the company\'s information security and are often required by
regulations or third-party agreements. Any user accessing the company\'s
computer systems can affect the security of all users of the network. An
appropriate Network Access and Authentication Policy reduces risk of a
security incident by requiring consistent application of authentication
and access standards across the network.

2.0 Purpose
===========

The purpose of this policy is to describe what steps must be taken to
ensure that users connecting to the corporate network are authenticated
in an appropriate manner, in compliance with company standards, and are
given the least amount of access required to perform their job function.
This policy specifies what constitutes appropriate use of network
accounts and authentication standards.

3.0 Scope
=========

The scope of this policy includes all users who have access to
company-owned or company-provided computers or require access to the
corporate network and/or systems. This policy applies not only to
employees, but also to guests, contractors, and anyone requiring access
to the corporate network.

Public access to the company\'s externally-reachable systems, such as
its corporate website or public web applications, are specifically
excluded from this policy.

4.0 Policy
==========

4.1 Account Setup
-----------------

During initial account setup, the following policies apply:

-   Positive ID and coordination with Human Resources is required.

-   Users will be granted least amount of network access required to
    perform their job function.

-   Users will be granted access only if they accept the Acceptable Use
    Policy.

-   Access to the network will be granted in accordance with the
    Acceptable Use Policy.

4.2 Account Use
---------------

For network accounts, the following policies apply:

-   For company employees, accounts must be created using a standard
    format of \[firstinitial\]\[lastname\]. Do we need a policy deviation here?

-   For authorised temporary employees, contractors, or other
    individuals, accounts must be created using a standard format for
    example something similar to:

    -   \[firstinitial\]\[lastname\]\[temporary\]

    -   \[firstinitial\]\[lastname\]\[contractor\]

    -   \[firstinitial\]\[lastname\]\[consultant\]

-   Accounts must be password protected in accordance with the Password
    Policy.

-   Accounts must be for individuals only.

-   Where shared service accounts are required, the following applies;

    -   Where possible, identification of the individual must be
        audited.

    -   Only authorised individuals should have access to shared
        accounts.

    -   Access to shared accounts should be reviewed on a quarterly
        basis.

    -   Credentials to access shared accounts should be changed once an
        individual no longer requires access.

4.3 Account Termination
-----------------------

In the event of an employee, temporary employee, contractor or
consultant leaving the company HR must notify the Head of IT or
delegated administrator, and network access and associated accounts must
be disabled.

4.4 Network Authentication
--------------------------

Any device connecting to the company network must authenticate. If
authentication cannot occur, then the device must not be permitted to
access the network.

4.5 Use of Passwords
--------------------

When accessing the network locally, two-factor authentication should be
implemented where possible.

4.6 Remote Network Access
-------------------------

Remote access must adhere to the Remote Access Policy.

4.7 Screensaver Passwords
-------------------------

Screensaver passwords are required to be activated after 5 minutes of
inactivity.

4.8 Minimum Configuration for Access
------------------------------------

Users must not be permitted network access if corporate standards with
regard to antivirus software and patch levels on their machines are not
met.

4.9 Encryption
--------------

Authentication credentials must be encrypted during transmission across
any network, whether the transmission occurs internal to the company
network or across a public network such as the Internet.

4.10 Failed Logins
------------------

The Company must lock a user\'s account after 5 unsuccessful logins.

When login failures occur, the error message transmitted to the user
must not indicate specifically whether the account name or password were
incorrect. The error must only state \"the username and/or password you
supplied were incorrect.\"

4.11 Outside Normal Business Hours
----------------------------------

The Company does not mandate time-of-day network access lockouts, but
audit and logging of this activity must be enabled and reviewed.

4.12 Applicability of Other Policies
------------------------------------

This document is part of the company\'s cohesive set of security
policies. Other policies may apply to the topics covered in this
document and as such the applicable policies should be reviewed as
needed.

5.0 Enforcement

This policy will be enforced by the Head of IT and/or Executive Team.
Violations may result in disciplinary action, which may include
suspension, restriction of access, or more severe penalties up to and
including termination of employment. Where illegal activities or theft
of company property (physical or intellectual) are suspected, the
