### 1.0 Overview

The need to retain data varies widely with the type of data.  Some data can be immediately deleteddeleted, and some must be retained until reasonable potential for future need no longer exists.  Since this can be somewhat subjective, a retention policy is important to ensure that the company&#39;s guidelines on retention are consistently applied throughout the organiszation.

### 2.0 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to specify the company&#39;s guidelines for retaining different types of data.

### 3.0 Scope

The scope of this policy covers all company data stored on company-owned, company-leased, and otherwise company-provided systems and media, regardless of location.

The need to retain certain information can be mandated by local, industry, or federal regulations.  Where this policy differs from applicable regulations, the policy specified in the regulations will apply.



### 4.0 Policy

#### 4.1 Reasons for Data Retention

Some data must be retained in order to protect the company&#39;s interests, preserve evidence, and generally conform to good business practices.  Some reasons for data retention include:

- Litigation
- Accident investigation
- Security incident investigation
- Regulatory requirements
- Intellectual property preservation

#### 4.2 Data Duplication

When identifying and classifying company data, it is important to determine where that data is stored.  This policy applies to all duplicates of the information regardless of location.

#### 4.3 Retention Requirements

This section sets guidelines for retaining the different types of company data.

### 4.3.1 Personal

No personal data must be retained no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was obtained.

### 4.3.2 Public

Public data must be retained for at least 1 year.

### 4.3.3 Operational

Operational data must be retained for at least 2 years.

### 4.3.4 Critical

Critical data must be retained for at least 7 years.

### 4.3.5 Confidential

Confidential data must be retained for at least 7 years.

#### 4.4 Retention of Encrypted Data

If any information retained under this policy is stored in an encrypted format, considerations must be taken for secure storage of the encryption keys.  Encryption keys must be retained as long as the data that the keys decrypt is retained.

#### 4.5 Data Destruction

When the retention timeframe expires, the company must review and take appropriate measures to actively destroy the data covered by this policy.

If a user feels that certain data should not be destroyed, they should identify the data to their supervisor so that an exception to the policy can be considered.  Since this decision has long-term legal implications, exceptions will be approved only by a member or members of the company&#39;s executive team.

The company specifically directs users not to destroy data in violation of this policy.  Particularly forbidden is destroying data that a user may feel is harmful to themselves, or destroying data in an attempt to cover up a violation of law or company policy.

#### 4.6 Applicability of Other Policies

This document is part of the company&#39;s cohesive set of security policies.  Other policies may apply to the topics covered in this document and as such the applicable policies should be reviewed as needed.

### 5.0 Enforcement

This policy will be enforced by the IT Manager and/or Executive Team. Violations may result in disciplinary action, which may include suspension, restriction of access, or more severe penalties up to and including termination of employment. Where illegal activities or theft of company property (physical or intellectual) are suspected, the company may report such activities to the applicable authorities.
