4.0 Policy
==========

4.1 Inventory of Information Assets
-----------------------------------

The company must draw up and maintain inventories of all information
assets that it relies

upon. These should identify each asset and all associated data required
for risk assessment,

information/records management and disaster recovery.

At a minimum, it must include the following;

-   Information Asset Type

-   Location

-   Designated owner

-   Security classification (See section 4.5)

-   Format

-   Backup

-   Licensing information

4.2 Assigning Information Asset Owners
--------------------------------------

All important information assets must have a nominated owner and be
accounted for. An information asset owner must be of the appropriate
role for the data classification of the asset they own. The owner's
responsibility for the asset and the requirement for them to maintain it
should be formalised and agreed.

### 4.2.1. Unclassified and trivial information assets

Items of information that are of limited or no practical value should
not be assigned a formal owner or inventoried.

### 4.2.2. Information assets with short term or localised use

For new documents that have a specific, short term, localised use, the
creator of the document will be the originator. This includes letters,
spreadsheets and reports created by staff. All staff must be informed of
their responsibility for the documents they create.

### 4.2.3. Corporate information assets

For information assets whose use throughout the Company is widespread
and whose origination is as a result of a group or strategic decision,
a corporate owner must be designated and the responsibility clearly 
documented. This should be the person who uses it the most, or has the
most control over it.

4.3 Acceptable use of Information Assets
----------------------------------------

The Acceptable Use Policy applies to all applicable Information Assets.
Please refer to the Acceptable Use Policy for guidance.

4.4 Information classification
------------------------------

On creation, all information assets must be assessed and classified and
labelled by the owner. The classification will determine how the
document should be protected and who should be

allowed access to it.

Data residing on corporate systems must be classified into the following
categories:

-   Personal

    -   includes user\'s personal data, emails, documents, etc. This
        policy excludes personal information, so no further guidelines
        apply.

-   Public

    -   includes already-released marketing material, commonly known
        information, etc. There are no requirements for public
        information.

-   Operational

    -   includes data for basic business operations, communications with
        vendors, employees, etc. (non-confidential). The majority of
        data will fall into this category.

-   Critical

    -   any information deemed critical to business operations (often
        this data is operational or confidential as well). It is
        extremely important to identify critical data for security and
        backup purposes.

-   Confidential

    -   any information deemed proprietary to the business or is HR
        related. See the Confidential Data Policy for more detailed
        information about how to handle confidential data.

See Data Classification Policy for further details.

4.5 Sharing Information Assets with Third Parties
-------------------------------------------------

Where classified Company Information Assets are shared with, or
transferred to, third parties, it is essential that both parties must
understand each other's classification system.

Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) must be in place where appropriate (See
4.6 below).

4.6 NDAs and Information Sharing Protocols
------------------------------------------

Where the Company needs to share classified information with a third
party organisation an appropriate risk assessment must be carried out
and the results of this must be reflected in a non-disclosure agreement
that the third party is required to sign.

Where regular sharing of classified information between the Company and
other organisations is required then an Information Sharing Protocol
must be agreed. The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) must be complied with
when sharing Information Assets with third parties.

TLP:RED

-   Not for disclosure, restricted to participants only.

    -   Sources may use TLP:RED when information cannot be effectively
        acted upon by additional parties, and could lead to impacts on a
        party\'s privacy, reputation, or operations if misused.
        Recipients may not share TLP:RED information with any parties
        outside of the specific exchange, meeting, or conversation in
        which it was originally disclosed. In the context of a meeting,
        for example, TLP:RED information is limited to those present at
        the meeting. In most circumstances, TLP:RED should be exchanged
        verbally or in person.

TLP:AMBER

-   Limited disclosure, restricted to participants' organisations.

    -   Sources may use TLP:AMBER when information requires support to
        be effectively acted upon, yet carries risks to privacy,
        reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organisations
        involved. Recipients may only share TLP:AMBER information with
        members of their own organisation, and with clients or customers
        who need to know the information to protect themselves or
        prevent further harm. Sources are at liberty to specify
        additional intended limits of the sharing: these must be adhered
        to.

TLP:GREEN

-   Limited disclosure, restricted to the community.

    -   Sources may use TLP:GREEN when information is useful for the
        awareness of all participating organisations as well as with
        peers within the broader community or sector. Recipients may
        share TLP:GREEN information with peers and partner organisations
        within their sector or community, but not via publicly
        accessible channels. Information in this category can be
        circulated widely within a particular community. TLP:GREEN
        information may not be released outside of the community.

TLP:WHITE

-   Disclosure is not limited.

    -   Sources may use TLP:WHITE when information carries minimal or no
        foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules
        and procedures for public release. Subject to standard copyright
        rules, TLP:WHITE information may be distributed without
        restriction.

4.7 Information Asset Labelling, Handling and Disposal
------------------------------------------------------

The company must implement a set of procedures for Information Asset
labelling, handling and disposal.

-   Labelling

    -   Any Information Asset labelling must inform the user of the
        contents without revealing unnecessary details or attracting
        attention.

-   Handling

    -   For data handling refer to the Data Classification Policy.

-   Disposal

    -   For data disposal and destruction refer to the Data Retention
        Policy.

4.8 Legal disclaimers
---------------------

The company requires the use of disclaimers on every outgoing email or
electronic communication, which must contain the following notices:

-   The email is for the intended recipient only.

-   The email may contain private information.

-   If the email is received in error, the sender should be notified and
    any copies of the email destroyed.

-   Any unauthorised review, use, or disclosure of the contents is
    prohibited.
