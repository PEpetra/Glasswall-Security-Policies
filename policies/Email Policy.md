### 1.0 Overview

Email is an essential component of business communication; however, it presents a particular set of challenges due to its potential to introduce a security threat to the network.  Email can also have an effect on the company&#39;s liability by providing a written record of communications, so having a well thought out policy is essential.  This policy outlines expectations for appropriate, safe, and effective email use.

### 2.0 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to detail the company&#39;s usage guidelines for the email system.  This policy will help the company reduce risk of an email-related security incident, foster good business communications both internal and external to the company, and provide for consistent and professional application of the company&#39;s email usage.

### 3.0 Scope

This policy covers appropriate use of any email sent from a Company email address and applies to all employees, vendors, and agents operating on behalf of the Company.



### 4.0 Policy

#### 4.1 Proper Use of Company Email Systems

Users are asked to exercise common sense when sending or receiving email from company accounts. Additionally, the following applies to the proper use of the company email system.

### 4.1.1 Sending Email

When using a company email account, email must be addressed and sent carefully.  Users should keep in mind that the company loses any control of email once it is sent external to the company network.  Users must take extreme care when typing in addresses, particularly when email address auto-complete features are enabled; using the &quot;reply all&quot; function; or using distribution lists in order to avoid inadvertent information disclosure to an unintended recipient.  Careful use of email will help the company avoid the unintentional disclosure of sensitive or non-public information.

### 4.1.2 Personal Use and General Guidelines

- Company email accounts should be used for Company business related purposes. Personal communication of a non-business nature is permitted on a limited basis.
- The company email system shall not to be used for the creation or distribution of any disruptive or offensive messages, including but not limited to offensive comments about race, gender, hair colour, disabilities, age, sexual orientation, pornography, religious beliefs and practice, political beliefs, or national origin. Employees who receive any emails with this content from any Company employee should report the matter to their supervisor immediately.
- Information that is considered confidential or proprietary to the company may not be sent via email, regardless of the recipient, without being encrypted.
- It is company policy not to open email attachments from unknown senders, or when such attachments are unexpected.
- Email systems were not designed to transfer large files and as such emails should not contain attachments totalling in excess of 10MB.

Please note that the topics above are covered in more detail in sections below.

### 4.1.3 Business Communications and Email

The company uses email as an important communication medium for business operations.  Users of the corporate email system are expected to check and respond to email in a consistent and timely manner during business hours.

Additionally, users are asked to recognise that email sent from a company account reflects on the company, and, as such, email must be used with professionalism and courtesy.

### 4.1.4 Email Signature

An email signature (contact information appended to the bottom of each outgoing email) is required for all emails sent from the company email system.   At a minimum, the signature should include the user&#39;s:

Email signatures may not include links to personal social media accounts such as LinkedIn or Twitter, or include personal statements or messages (political, humorous, life tips etc).

### 4.1.5 Auto-Responder

The company requires the use of an auto-responder if the user will be out of the office for an entire business day or more.

The auto-response should contain minimal information and only notify the sender of the following;

- That the user is out of the office or unattainable.
- Alternative contact details should they be required for escalation or further assistance.

### 4.1.6 Mass Emailing

The company makes the distinction between the sending of mass emails and the sending of unsolicited email (spam) due to being strictly prohibited by law.
