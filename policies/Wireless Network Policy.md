## 1.0 Overview

Wireless communications are essential to a productive workplace, as devices continue to evolve and reduce their reliance on physical media to connect to the company network.  Wireless networks can provide convenient network access for third parties such as visitors or contractors.  However, wireless networks can introduce security risks to the network that can be mitigated with an appropriate Wireless Network Policy.  

## 2.0 Purpose 

This policy outlines the steps to secure company owned wireless networks and infrastructure.

## 3.0 Scope 

This policy further covers all company owned wireless infrastructure, including but not limited to, access points, routers, wireless network interface cards, and anything else capable of transmitting or receiving a wireless network signal.

    - Where possible, access points must be located central to their environment.
    - Access points must not be placed in public or easily accessed locations.
    - Access points must be placed in non-obvious locations.
- Physical requirements;
    - Any physical labels with default administrator credentials and passwords must be recorded in the asset register and then removed or etched to become illegible.

- Wireless networking must not be deployed in a manner that will circumvent the company's security controls.

#### 4.2.2 Wireless Access Encryption Configuration

- Encryption must be used at all times.
- Only WPA2 using AES, or stronger, encryption types must be used.

- Software and/or firmware on the wireless access points must be updated prior to deployment.
- Software and/or firmware on the wireless access points must be updated when available

### 4.3 Inactivity

Inactive wireless access points should be disabled.

### 4.4 Audits

The wireless network audit must;
- Be undertaken at least twice each year to ensure that this policy is being followed.
- Cover location of access points, signal strength, SSID, and use of strong encryption.
- Use only company approved audit software.

### 4.5 Guest Wireless Internet Access Point
