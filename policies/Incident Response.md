### 1.0 Overview

A security incident can come in many forms: a malicious attacker gaining access to the network, a virus or other malware infecting computers, or even a stolen laptop containing confidential data.  A well-thought-out Incident Response Policy is critical to successful recovery from an incident.  This policy covers all incidents that may affect the security and integrity of the company&#39;s information assets, and outlines steps to take in the event of such an incident.

### 2.0 Purpose

This policy is intended to ensure that the company is prepared if a security incident were to occur.  It details what must occur if an incident is suspected, covering both electronic and physical security incidents.

### 3.0 Scope

The scope of this policy covers all information assets owned or provided by the company, whether they reside on the corporate network or elsewhere.

### 4.0 Policy

#### 4.1 Types of Incidents

For the purposes of this policy a security incident is defined as one of the following:

- Electronic: This type of incident can range from an attacker or malicious user accessing the network for unauthorised purposes, or a malware infection.
- Physical: A physical IT security incident involves the loss or theft of a laptop, mobile device, Smartphone, tablet, portable storage device, or other digital device that may contain sensitive or company confidential information.

#### 4.2 Preparation

The company must identify a third-party IT Security company that offers incident response services to ensure that high-end resources are quickly available during an incident.

The company should review any industry or governmental regulations that dictate how it must respond to a security incident (specifically, loss of customer data), and ensure that its incident response plans adhere to these regulations.

The company should develop a communications process for incident response in the event that corporate communications systems may have been compromised.

Prior to an incident, the company must ensure that the following is clear to IT personnel:

- What actions to take when an incident is suspected or reported.
- Who is responsible for responding to an incident.

Prior to an incident, the company must ensure that the following is clear to all personnel:

- Incidents must be reported at the earliest opportunity on the basis that enforcement of this policy supports openness, trust and learning from security incidents.

#### 4.3 Confidentiality

All information related to an electronic or physical security incident must be treated as confidential information until the incident is fully contained.  This will serve both to protect employees&#39; reputations (if an incident is due to an error, negligence, or carelessness), and to control the release of information to the media and/or customers.

Details of security incidents must not be;

- Shared with unauthorised individuals.
- Made public by unauthorised staff.
- Discussed in an open forum.

#### 4.4 Electronic Incidents

When an electronic incident is suspected, the company&#39;s goal is to recover as quickly as possible, limit the damage done, and secure the network.  An incident response plan must be developed to include the following steps:

1. Remove the compromised device from the network by unplugging or disabling network connection.  Do not power down the machine.
2. Disable or change the password of the compromised account(s) as appropriate.
3. Report the incident to the IT Manager.
4. Backup all data and logs on the machine, or copy/image the machine to another system isolated from company networks.
5. Determine exactly what happened and the scope of the incident.
6. Notify company management/executives as appropriate. Incident response notifications
7. Contact the retained third party IT Security company as needed.
8. Determine how the attacker gained access and disable this access.
9. If the system is to be reused in the production environment, rebuild the system in accordance with the company standard.
10. Where possible restore any needed data and put the system back online.
11. Ensure that other company systems are not prone to the same or similar vulnerabilities.
12. Carry out a post incident investigation review to communicate and build on lessons learnt.
13. Update policy, controls and processes where required.

#### 4.5 Physical Incidents

Physical security incidents, regardless of cause, must be treated as if they were targeted at the company.

The company must assume that such a loss will occur at some point, and periodically survey a random sampling of laptops and mobile devices to determine the risk if one were to be lost or stolen.

### 4.5.1 Response

Establish the severity of the incident by determining the data stored on the missing device.  This can often be done by referring to a recent backup of the device.  Two important questions must be answered:

- Was confidential data involved?

-
  - If not, refer to &quot;Loss Contained&quot; below.
  - If confidential data was involved, refer to &quot;Data Loss Suspected&quot; below.

- Was strong encryption used?

-
  - If strong encryption was used, refer to &quot;Loss Contained&quot; below.
  - If not, refer to &quot;Data Loss Suspected&quot; below.

### 4.5.2 Loss Contained

First, change any usernames, passwords, account information, WEP/WPA keys, passphrases, etc., that were stored on the system.  Notify the IT Manager.  Replace the lost hardware and restore data from the last backup.  Notify the applicable authorities if a theft has occurred.

### 4.5.3 Data Loss Suspected

First, notify the executive team, legal counsel, and/or public relations group so that each team can evaluate and prepare a response in their area.

Change any usernames, passwords, account information, WEP/WPA keys, passphrases, etc., that were stored on the system.  Replace the lost hardware and restore data from the last backup.  Notify the applicable authorities as needed if a theft has occurred and follow disclosure guidelines specified in the notification section.

Review procedures to ensure that risk of future incidents is reduced by implementing stronger physical security controls.

#### 4.6 Notification

If an electronic or physical security incident is suspected to have resulted in the loss of third-party/customer data, notification of the public or affected entities should occur in compliance with local regulation.

The executive team and legal counsel must determine an appropriate course of action.

If external notification is deemed appropriate, it should occur in an organized and consistent manner in compliance with local regulation.

#### 4.7 Managing Risk

Managing risk of a security incident or data loss is the primary reason to create and maintain a comprehensive security policy.  Risks can come in many forms: electronic risks like data corruption, computer viruses, hackers, or malicious users; or physical risks such as loss/theft of a device, hardware failure, fire, or a natural disaster.  Protecting critical data and systems from these risks is of paramount importance to the company.

### 4.7.1 Risk Assessment

As part of the risk management process, the company must conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks (man-made and natural) and any vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the company&#39;s critical or confidential information.  An assessment must be thorough, can be performed by company personnel or external consultants (or both), and must be well documented.

### 4.7.2 Risk Management Program

A formal risk management program must be implemented to cover any risks known to the company (which should be identified through a risk assessment), and ensure that reasonable security measures are in place to mitigate any identified risks to a level that will ensure the continued security of the company&#39;s confidential and critical data.

#### 4.8 Applicability of Other Policies

This document is part of the company&#39;s cohesive set of security policies.  Other policies may apply to the topics covered in this document and as such the applicable policies should be reviewed as needed.

### 5.0 Enforcement

This policy will be enforced by the IT Manager and/or Executive Team. Violations may result in disciplinary action, which may include suspension, restriction of access, or more severe penalties up to and including termination of employment. Where illegal activities or theft of company property (physical or intellectual) are suspected, the company may report such activities to the applicable authorities.
