Glasswall is hereinafter referred to as "the company."

## 1.0 Overview

Information assets are assets to the company just like physical property.  In order to determine the value of the asset and how it should be handled, data must be classified according to its importance to company operations and the confidentiality of its contents.  Once this has been determined, the company can take steps to ensure that data is treated appropriately.

## 2.0 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to detail a method for classifying data and to specify how to handle this data once it has been classified.  

## 3.0 Scope

The scope of this policy covers all company data stored on company-owned, company-leased, company approved cloud services, and otherwise company-provided systems and media, regardless of location.  Also covered by the policy are hardcopies of company data, such as printouts, faxes, notes, etc.

## 4.0 Policy

## 4.1 Data Classification

Data residing on corporate systems must be continually evaluated and classified into the following categories:

- Personal
-	includes user's personal data, emails, documents, etc.  This policy excludes personal information, so no further guidelines apply.
-	Public
-	includes already-released marketing material, commonly known information, etc.  There are no requirements for public information.
-	Operational
-	includes data for basic business operations, communications with vendors, employees, etc. (non-confidential).  The majority of data will fall into this category.
-	Critical
-	any information deemed critical to business operations (often this data is operational or confidential as well).  It is extremely important to identify critical data for security and backup purposes.
-	Confidential
-	any information deemed proprietary to the business or is HR related.  See the Confidential Data Policy for more detailed information about how to handle confidential data.

## 4.2 Data Storage

#### 4.2.5 Confidential

#### 4.3.4 Critical

There are no requirements on transmission of critical data, unless the data in question is also considered operational or confidential, in which case the applicable policy statements would apply.

#### 4.3.5 Confidential

#### 4.4.5 Confidential

Confidential data must be destroyed in a manner that makes recovery of the information impossible.  The following guidelines apply:

-	Paper/documents: crosscut shredding is required.
-	Storage media (CD's, DVD's): physical destruction is required.
-	The following applies to, but is not limited to, Hard Drives, USB Storage Devices etc:

-	Physical devices that cannot be overwritten or wiped must be destroyed beyond recovery.

### 4.5 Applicability of Other Policies

This document is part of the company's cohesive set of security policies.  Other policies may apply to the topics covered in this document and as such the applicable policies should be reviewed as needed.

## 5.0 Enforcement

This policy will be enforced by the IT Manager and/or Executive Team. Violations may result in disciplinary action, which may include suspension, restriction of access, or more severe penalties up to and including termination of employment. Where illegal activities or theft of company property (physical or intellectual) are suspected, the company may report such activities to the applicable authorities.
